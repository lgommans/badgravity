<strong>Quick tips:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Use arrow keys to control the space ship.
	<li> Click on a body to focus on it, scroll to zoom.
	<li> Hover your mouse over the settings for info.
	<li> There should be a little tutorial on the top left (not shown if you've completed it in the past).
</ul>

That's all you need to get started, I think. The rest should be
self-explanatory. Let me know if it's not!<br><br>

<strong><a href="./">Bad Gravity</a> is a small simulator I made
because</strong> I had a very hard time finding an existing minigame where I
can just pilot a ship without installing software, perhaps buying it, then
building a rocket that must first make it into orbit... I just had questions
about orbital mechanics that online videos weren't answering and I figured: how
hard could this be to make? Well... here we are :)<br><br>

<strong>Time controls.</strong> The simulation always tries to do 60
<i>runs</i> per second, but in every run you can do multiple <i>steps</i>. In a
step, the amount of attraction that each body feels towards each other is
updated, their positions are updated, and the line is drawn. By doing more
steps per run, the simulation runs faster, but your computer is limited in how
many steps it can do before at 60 runs per second. To speed up further, the
<i>time per step</i> control lets you increase the amount of time that passes
in each step, but it gets less precise because there is more distance between
each time the forces are calculated.<br><br>

<strong>Spacebar</strong> creates a light body, pushed from A into the
direction of the mouse. It was meant to simulate: what would happen if you
shoot a bullet from a spacecraft? If A is moving relative to your target, it's
no bug that the new body doesn't move directly towards the mouse!<br><br>


<strong>Units</strong>

<ul>
	<li> Mass: kilograms
	<li> Distance: meters
	<li> Speed: meters per second
	<li> Scale: 1 pixel = 1 Gm by default (configurable)
	<li> Thrust: newtons
	<li> Time unit: approximately 6.13 minutes
		<ul>
			<li> This is the amount of time passing in one step when <i>time per step = 1</i>
			<li> Earth goes around the Sun in roughly <i>t = 365.24&times;24&times;60</i> minutes
			<li> Presume the time controls are set to 1, that is, <i>time per step = 1</i> and <i>steps per run = 1</i>
			<li> Presume the simulation runs at 60 frames per second
			<li> Earth will go around in <i>t/6.13/fps/tps/spr = 525960/6.13/60/1/1 = 1430</i> minutes
			<li> With <i>time per step = 100</i> and <i>steps per run = 10</i>, it goes around in 1.430 minutes
		</ul>
</ul>

<strong>Thanks</strong> to Paul Lutus over at <a href="https://arachnoid.com/orbital_dynamics/">https://arachnoid.com/orbital_dynamics/</a>
for releasing their code as GPLv2! Their simulation is written in a straightforward
manner that made it perfect to learn from. Also special thanks to my good
friend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric for frequent feedback and expert advice on
anything game-dev related. Even <i>Bad</i> Gravity was not made in isolation :-)
