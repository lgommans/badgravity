<strong>Quick tips:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> Use arrow keys to control the space ship.
	<li> Click on a body to focus on it, scroll to zoom.
	<li> Hover your mouse over the settings for info.
</ul>

That's all you need to get started, I think. The rest should be
self-explanatory. Let me know if it's not!<br><br>

<strong>Challenges</strong> (from easy to hard):

<br><br>(outdated)

<ul>
	<li> Create a very excentric orbit, passing super close to G but stay on screen.
	<li> Set G's mass to 3e6 and A's to 1e6, then restart and keep G on the screen.
	<li> Set G's mass to 3000 and A's to 100, then restart and get a speed boost of &gt;2500 in any direction from G.
	<li> Shoot a new body into G (spacebar).
	<li> Shoot a body in such a way that it gets into a stable orbit around G, then dock with the new object.
	<li> Create a small solar system with the Add Body button and do transfer orbits.
</ul>

<strong><a href="./">Bad Gravity</a> is a small simulator I made
because</strong> I had a very hard time finding an existing minigame where I
can just pilot a ship without installing software, perhaps buying it, then
building a rocket that must first make it into orbit... I just had questions
about orbital mechanics that online videos weren't answering and I figured: how
hard could this be to make? Well... here we are :)<br><br>

<strong>To fast-forward</strong> or slow the game down, you can use the <i>time
per step</i> and <i>steps per run</i> controls. The simulation always tries to
do 60 <i>runs</i> per second, but in every run you can do multiple
<i>steps</i>. The former input field allows you to make more time pass per step
(reducing precision) and the latter how many steps you want to do per run
(losing simulation speed, if your computer can't keep up). Fast-forward by
increasing the latter. If you need even more speed and your CPU doesn't keep
up, increase the former.<br><br>

<strong>Spacebar</strong> creates a light body, pushed from A into the
direction of the mouse. It was meant to simulate: what would happen if you
shoot a bullet from a spacecraft? If A is moving relative to your target, it's
no bug that the new body doesn't move directly towards the mouse!<br><br>


<strong>Units</strong>

<ul>
	<li> Mass: kilograms
	<li> Distance: meters
	<li> Speed: meters per second
	<li> Scale: 1 pixel = 1 Gm by default (configurable)
	<li> Thrust: newtons
	<li> Time unit: approximately 6.13 minutes
		<ul>
			<li> This is the amount of time passing in one step when <i>time per step = 1</i>
			<li> Earth goes around the Sun in roughly <i>t = 365.24&times;24&times;60</i> minutes
			<li> Presume the time controls are set to 1, that is, <i>time per step = 1</i> and <i>steps per run = 1</i>
			<li> Presume the game runs at 60 frames per second
			<li> Earth will go around in-game in <i>t/6.13/fps/tps/spr = 525960/6.13/60/1/1 = 1430</i> minutes
			<li> With <i>time per step = 100</i> and <i>steps per run = 10</i>, it goes around in 1.430 minutes
		</ul>
</ul>

<strong>Thanks</strong> to Paul Lutus over at <a href="https://arachnoid.com/orbital_dynamics/">https://arachnoid.com/orbital_dynamics/</a>
for releasing their code as GPLv2! Their simulation is written in a straightforward
manner that made it perfect to learn from. Also special thanks to my good
friend Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric for frequent feedback and expert advice on
anything game-dev related. Even <i>Bad</i> Gravity was not made in isolation :-)
